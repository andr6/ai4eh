This repository contains the [workshop guide](ai-for-ethical-hacking.pdf), educational tools and scripts for learning how AI can be applied in offensive security.

## 🎯 Overview

The AI4EH workshop demonstrates some practical applications of AI in security, including:

- **AI Reconnaissance** - Generate contextual subdomain wordlists and automate target enumeration
- **Intelligent Screenshot Analysis** - Use neural networks and multimodal LLMs to classify web apps
- **Smart Content Discovery** - Create custom fuzzing wordlists based on application context
- **Automated Exploit Generation** - Explore nuclei AI template generation
- **Hackbots** - Play with CAI agents for vulnerability discovery
- **MCP Integrations** - Connect AI assistants to security tools like Burp Suite, Ghidra and more

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. **Build the container:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x build_image.sh
   ./build_image.sh
   ```

2. **Run the environment:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x run_image.sh
   ./run_image.sh
   ```

Or simply use the pre-built image:

```bash
docker run --rm -it --env-file env_file ethiack/ai4eh:latest
```

## 🛠️ Tools & Components

### Core Scripts

- **`llm_screenshot_classifier.py`** - Multimodal AI for categorizing web application screenshots
- **`scrape.py`** - Web scraping with analysis
- **`nlp.py`** - NLP utility for keyword extraction and text analysis
- **`cai_custom_xss_tool_with_notify.py`** - AI agent example with a simple custom tool for notifications
